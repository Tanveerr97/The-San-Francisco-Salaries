# The-San-Francisco-Salaries
**Project Title: The San Francisco Salaries Analysis**
*Project Description*:
In this project, I analyzed the San Francisco Salaries dataset using Excel to generate insightful reports, create interactive dashboards, and answer key questions related to employee compensation. The main objectives were to understand salary distributions, identify high-paying departments, and analyze salary trends over the years.
*Key Features and Tasks*:

*Data Cleaning and Preparation*:

Imported the San Francisco Salaries dataset into Excel.
Cleaned and organized the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing column names.
*Pivot Tables for In-Depth Analysis*:

Created Pivot Tables to summarize total pay, base pay, and overtime pay by job title, department, and year.
Analyzed salary distributions and identified the highest  job categories.
Explored trends in overtime pay across departments.
*Interactive Dashboard*:

Designed an interactive dashboard with dynamic slicers for filtering by year, department, and job title.
Visualized key metrics such as average base pay, total compensation, and overtime trends using bar charts and pie charts.
Incorporated conditional formatting for easy identification of top earners and budget outliers.
*Question Solving and Insights Generation*:
1.	Filter and sort the Pivot to show the 5 employees who earned the highest Base Pay in 2011. Who were they?
2.	Among employees with >=$100k Base Pay in 2012, Did any employee earn more than 50% of their salary from Other Pay? If so, who?
3.	Clear all filters and pull in Job Category and Job Title as row labels (Titles sorted alphabetically), then group any titles including the word "Curator" into a new category called "Curator". How many employees held some sort of Curator position in either 2012 or 2013? Among those, who earned the highest average base pay?
*Reporting and Presentation:*

Compiled the findings into a comprehensive report.
Presented the dashboard and key insights to stakeholders for strategic decision-making.
*Tools Used:*

Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning, Pivot Table analysis, and dashboard creation.
Data Visualization: Charts and graphs to enhance data storytelling and insight generation.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in using Excel for data analysis, reporting, and dashboard development, showcasing my analytical and visualization skills relevant to a data analyst role.
